# CUIFs
Excel Add in functions to count unique items based on criteria

XLAM file containing the following Functions.
 CountUnique(Range)
 
 CountUniqueIF(Range, criteria)
 
 CountUniqueIFS(Range, cell from Result column, 1 or more criteria)

I created this to work out how many of each sample type we would receive in a day based from our received schedule file.
I'm sure it could be improved upon, but it suffices for our needs.
Feel free to use this as you wish. Any feedback would be appreciated. If you find it useful let me know :)
